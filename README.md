# Project Title

PudgyPals

## Overview

An app allows users to monitor their weight progress, set goals, and record daily weights, providing insights and trends over time

### Problem

Obesity is a problem that many people face now, including myself. Making the decision to lose weight is not easy in itself. Most apps on the market are often integrated with various functions that can be overwhelming and seem overly complicated. This can make losing weight seem like an even more daunting task. Therefore, I decided to create PudgePals. PudgePals is a simple and straightforward app that is designed solely for tracking weight changes. This will make it easier for people to take the first step towards their weight loss goals.

### User Profile

#### Who will use it?

- People looking to lose weight or manage their weight.
- Individuals who are self-motivated and want a simple tool to track progress.
- People who find other weight loss apps overwhelming or complex.
- Users who may be discouraged by the difficulty of weight loss and need a clear starting point.

#### How will they use it?

- Regularly log their weight to monitor changes over time.
- See a clear and simple record of their weight loss journey.
- Track progress without the distraction of additional features.
- Focus on the core goal of weight management without feeling overwhelmed.
